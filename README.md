 RESTful API project

 to do:

 authentication is a bit buggy, something to do with the process of comparing the input to what is on the database, so it fails in situations where it should succeed.

 formating issues in the posting request

 unit testing was not done yet, should be done eventually

once everything is working, the dockerfile needs to be made so that everything is containerized. the database already runs in docker, but the api doesnt yet.
